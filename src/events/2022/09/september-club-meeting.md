Tï»¿he [Riverbend Malt House homebrew competition first announced in July](https://mailchi.mp/53265e3af689/riverbend-malt-competition) is set to be judged at this September's regular meeting!

The theme of this competition is to highlight the fresh grain from [Riverbend Malt House](https://riverbendmalt.com) (generously donated to the club through Charles Bockway) and so this should be an exciting time to enjoy the best, in my opinion, of our club's autumnal beers.

Join us this month at Breathe Wine in Cross Lanes again. We'll have some exciting club announcements as well!
