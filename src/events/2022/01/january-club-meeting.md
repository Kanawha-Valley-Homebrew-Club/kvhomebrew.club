Our first meeting of the 2022 year will include hearing some vision from club officers for the year, upcoming events and our beer share/feedback time.

With Coal Country approaching we will dedicate feedback time to Stouts/Porters.

We look forward to seeing you there!

Room 134 in the ATC is our usual space this spring.
