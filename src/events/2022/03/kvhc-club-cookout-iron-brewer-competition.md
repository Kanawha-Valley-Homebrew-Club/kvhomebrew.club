The club will supply Hamburgers (beef), Hotdogs (beef) and Buns for all.\
Message Jedidiah if you cannot eat beef (I will have a few veggie burgers too).

Please bring sides/desserts as this is a pot luck type event. (Sign up: COMING SOON)

We will do a "People's Choice" judging of our Iron Brewer Beers , so make sure they are ready (and there is enough to share) here.
