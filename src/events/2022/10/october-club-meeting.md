This month's meeting will be 1 week earlier than usual at Breathe Wine in Cross Lanes. To be transparent, we wanted for all of the officer's to able to attend this meeting as it is going to be very important for the future of the club.

We will be discussing club business and of course sharing/drinking homebrew with the feedback circle. All dues paying members are highly encouraged to attend if possible.

Bring a friend and your homebrew! We hope to see you there! Cheers!
