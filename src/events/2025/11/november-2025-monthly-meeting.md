Join us for this month’s club meeting as we dive into one of the most valuable skill-builders in homebrewing: **off-flavor identification and troubleshooting.**\
Just like our previous tasting circles, we’ll follow the same guided format — tasting, discussing, and comparing notes together.

**What to Expect:**\
• A structured tasting circle focusing on off-flavors\
• Discussion on where each flaw originates and practical steps to avoid it\
• Group palate training — a must for dialing in competition-ready beer\
• Casual hangout, Q&A, and bottle sharing after the guided portion

**Who Should Come:**\
• New brewers who want to sharpen their palate\
• Experienced brewers who want a refresh or to help guide others\
• Anyone curious about how flavors work in beer

**Bring:**\
Optional bottles to share after the main tasting, curiosity, and your best brewing questions.

Let’s keep leveling up our brewing game together. 🍻\
**See you there!**
