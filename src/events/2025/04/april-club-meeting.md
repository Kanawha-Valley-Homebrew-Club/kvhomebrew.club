KV Homebrew Skills Challenge: Amber Ale Tasting Event!

The brews are in, the fermenters have settled, and now it’s time for the best part — tasting!

Join us for the official Amber Ale Skills Challenge Tasting, where we'll sample each member's take on the same exact recipe and ingredients. This is where brewing technique takes center stage — and where subtle differences in process come to life in the glass.

What to Expect: A tasting of all entries, discussion of brewing approaches, and plenty of great conversation with your fellow brewers.

Come ready to sip, learn, and talk shop. Whether you brewed or just want to taste the results, all members are welcome!

Let’s raise a glass to the skill behind the beer.
