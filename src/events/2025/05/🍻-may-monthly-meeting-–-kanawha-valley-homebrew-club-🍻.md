Join us for this month’s KVHC meeting as we dig into some of the most debated topics in homebrewing. Our education session will feature a **Brewing Mythbusters** theme, inspired by the hot takes and results from Brülosophy’s experiments. We’ll challenge conventional wisdom and question what really makes a difference in your beer.

Following the education session, we’ll move into our **tasting circle**, so bring a brew to share or come ready to sample and learn.

We’ll also be sharing details about this year’s **Summer Picnic** — including the theme for the Iron Brewer competition — so you won’t want to miss it!
