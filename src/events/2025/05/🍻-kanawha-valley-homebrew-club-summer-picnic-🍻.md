Join us for a day of great beer, great food, and great friends at our annual KVHC Summer Picnic! This year’s event will feature our always-exciting Iron Brewer Competition — and the theme is Cocktail-Inspired Beers. Think outside the stein and bring your best twist on a classic cocktail!

Whether you're competing or just coming to enjoy the creativity and camaraderie, we’d love to see you there. Bring your lawn chairs, homebrew, and appetite.

A signup site for the picnic will be posted soon, so keep an eye out.
