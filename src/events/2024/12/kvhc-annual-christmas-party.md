Hey everyone! Our annual Christmas party is Saturday, December 14th starting at 5pm. Food will be served at 6pm. I will be hosting it at my house again this year.

We will have a potluck for food. The SignUp Genius link is posted below. This is so we can keep track how many are coming, who’s bringing what and what we need. Feel free to bring other guests with you, but please RSVP them in your sign-up.

There will be a White Elephant gift exchange, so if you want to participate in it, make sure to bring a beer/brewing related gift valued at no more than $20.

Feel free to (please do) bring all of the beer that you want, homebrew or commercial.

My address is posted above, but if you have any questions, please let me know. I have plenty of parking.

Hope to see you there for an evening of Holiday cheers and beers!
