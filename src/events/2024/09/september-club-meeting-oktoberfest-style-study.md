Join us for our next **Kanawha Valley Homebrew Club** meeting, where we’ll dive into the rich tradition of Oktoberfest with an **Oktoberfest Style Study**. Whether you're a seasoned brewer or just starting your brewing journey, this educational session will explore the history, brewing techniques, and flavor profiles that define the iconic Oktoberfest beer style. Gain insights on how you can recreate these classic German flavors in your own homebrew!

Following the educational portion, we’ll have our **Tasting Circle**, where members bring their latest homebrew creations to share. This tradition embodies one of our core beliefs: “The joy of creating is great, but it’s best when shared.” Bring your latest brew, offer feedback, and connect with fellow brewers!
