J﻿oin us for our next monthly meeting. Get ready for a night filled with great brews and lively discussions.

W﻿e'll kick things off with a tasting circle featuring Coal Country competition recipes. Bring your latest creations or simply come ready to sample and share. It's a fantastic opportunity to gather inspiration and feedback from fellow brewers.

P﻿lus, we'll be diving into the details of the Coal Country Brewer's Cup competition. Whether you're a seasoned competitor or thinking about entering for the first time, this is your chance to learn more and strategize with fellow club members.

D﻿on't miss out on the fun! Mark your calendars. Let's raise a glass to the craft of homebrewing!
