  ### Malt/Grain Bill

  16 lb (7.3 kg) pale two-row\
  1 lb (454 g) crystal/caramel 150L\
  2 oz (57 g) chocolate malt

  ### Hops & Additions Schedule

  White Labs WLP001 California Ale
directions: >-
  Mill the grains and mash at 154°F (68°C) for 60 minutes. Vorlauf until
  runnings are clear, then run off into the kettle with first-wort hops. Sparge
  and top up as necessary to obtain about 6.5 gallons (25 liters)—or more,
  depending on your evaporation rate. Boil for 60 minutes, adding hops at
  flameout. Whirlpool for 15 minutes, then rest 10 minutes. Chill to 66°F
  (19°C), aerate well, and pitch plenty of healthy yeast. Ferment at 68°F (20°C)
  for 2–3 weeks or until terminal gravity is reached. Add dry hops. After 3
  days, cold-crash, package, and carbonate.
